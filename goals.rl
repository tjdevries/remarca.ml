goals
- extensible
    - (obviously)
    - you can add your own tags(functions), and they do stuff for you
    - in rst, you can do something like `::custom:mything:`
- write ocaml inside of it
    - this runs at some point, either compile time-ish or later
    - the ocaml can manipulate the document
- queryable
    - you can traverse the tree of all the nodes in your site
